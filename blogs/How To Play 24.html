			I learned the card game '24' from my dad, who learned it sometime during his childhood, at the tail-end of the Cultural Revolution in China.

			The simplicity of the game, combined with the mental strain needed, makes it popular among those who love a good brain teaser. It has been especially popular at Johns Hopkins University, where I attend college, since it is a place where everyone is a nerd at heart.

		<h5 class="blogSectionHeader"> Set Up </h5>
		<p class="blogParagraph">
			So, how exactly does one play '24'?

			The setup and rules are quite simple.

			Take a deck or two of cards, and take out all the face cards so that you are left with 40 or 80 cards: 1-10 (Aces always represent the number 1).

			From there, you divide the cards as evenly as you can among the players (any number of players is possible, but four players is ideal).

			The setup is complete!
		</p>
		<h5 class="blogSectionHeader"> Rules </h5>
		<p class="blogParagraph">
			In each round, four cards are placed in the middle. If you have four players, each player places one card; if you have a different number, it is simple enough to make adjustments so everyone places down an equal number of cards throughout the game, usually through cycling around the group.

			With the four cards, you can use any basic operations (plus, minus, multiplication, and division) to make them equal 24. The first person to develop a solution slaps the cards and explains their solution.


			For example, (6, 2, 5, 7) could become 24 by (6 x 2) + 5 + 7.


			You can make the game more complicated by adding rules like factorials, square roots, and more!


			Usually, the game never ends unless you have someone dominant and wins almost all the hands. The game usually ends in my family once everyone's brain gets tired.
