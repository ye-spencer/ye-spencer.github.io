			I learned the card game '24' from my dad, who learned it sometime during his childhood during the tailend of the Cultural Revolution in China.

			The simplicity of the game combined with the mind mental strain needed makes it popular among those who love a good brain teaser. It has been especially popular where I go to college at Johns Hopkins University, a place where everyone is a nerd at heart.

		<h5 class="blogSectionHeader"> Set Up </h5>
		<p class="blogParagraph">
			So how exactly does one play '24'?

			The set up and rules are really quite simple.

			Take a deck or two of cards, take out all of the face cards so that you are left with 40 or 80 cards: the numbers 1-10 (Ace represents the number 1).

			From there you divide the cards as evenly as you can among the players (any amount of players is possible, but 4 players is ideal).

			Set up is complete!
		</p>
		<h5 class="blogSectionHeader"> Rules </h5>
		<p class="blogParagraph">
			To play, each round you place 4 cards in the middle of the table. If you have 4 players, each player places one card; if you have a different amount, it is simple enough to make adjustments so everyone places down a fair amount of cards as the game progresses.

			With the 4 cards, you can use any basic operations (plus, minus, multiplication, and division) to try to get the cards to equal 24. Whoever comes up with a solution first slaps the cards and explains their solution.


			For example: (6, 2, 5, 7) could become 24 by (6 x 2) + 5 + 7.
			

			You can make the game more complicated by adding rules like factorials, square roots, and more! 


			The game never really ends, unless you have someone who is really dominant and wins almost all the hands. In my family, the game usually ends once everyone's brain gets tired.
