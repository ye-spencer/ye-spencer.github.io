		<p class="blogParagraph">
			The following is my life mission statement's first edition, the first revision. It will change as I change.

			If you are unaware of a life mission statement, I interpret it as a set of principles and values that guide my goals and daily actions. While I, or anyone else, may not live in perfect harmony with them, these principles act as ideals.

			I hope sharing my life mission statement allows others to learn about me on a relatively deep level, relatively quickly. I also hope to inspire at least one other person to make their own, reflect, and gain a better understanding of their aspirations as a person on a fundamental level.

			In this first edition, I focus on "being," even though it leads to a repetitive-sounding mission statement. I wrote it from almost a third-person viewpoint since the only personal verb is "I will be" because I am trying to separate my principles from myself.ewpoint since the only personal verb is "I will be," trying my best to separate my principles from myself.

		<h5 class="blogSectionHeader"> Statement </h5>
		<p class="blogParagraph">
			I will be competent and provide value to my environment. I will be someone who consistently goes the extra mile because I enjoy the process rather than worrying about the outcome. I will be someone who gives back, especially to those who have helped me, and pays back kindness tenfold. 

			I will be someone who gives their total effort when it matters.

			I will be loyal to those I care about.

			I will be someone who understands that I am and will never be a perfect being, but that won't stop me from improving every day. I will be someone who seeks discomfort, is open to new experiences, and grows and improves from them every day. I will be someone who seeks feedback even in good times.

			I will be proactive, someone who understands that they are the only person who has full control over their life. Someone who does not wait for life to happen but rather takes initiative and does so quickly to create what needs to be made, alter what needs to be altered, and terminate what needs to end.

			I will be honorable. I will be someone who keeps their word, honors their prior commitments in the chronological order they made them, and does not speak ill of others.

			I will be humble.

			I will be someone who acknowledges when they are wrong or when they don't know.

			I will be someone who understands how everyone comes from different experiences: different families, upbringings, struggles, joys, likes, and dislikes; this all affects their thought process, view on life, and mannerisms. I will be understanding of these differences. I will be empathetic and understand the thoughts, emotions, and behaviors of others without judgment or criticism because I will be someone who knows that if I were in the exact same position after experiencing everything they had, I would be exactly the same.

			I will be open-minded and accept that I can and will be mistaken. I will be someone who can focus on learning from mistakes and failures, never letting them discourage me because everyone fails. One success often outweighs a hundred failures.

			In the words of Franklin Covey, I will be independent and self-reliant to become interdependent. Then, I will be free to do anything I choose.

			I will be grateful for everything and find happiness in the small things.

			I will be self-aware and be cognizant of my thoughts, emotions, habits, triggers, and more.

			I will be healthy. I will be someone who makes health-conscious decisions relating to diet and exercise to enjoy life longer.

			I will be someone who can delay gratification and make sound long-term plans.
