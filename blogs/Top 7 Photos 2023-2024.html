			The following eight photos are my favorite for a wide range of reasons. I will admit there is a sense of recency bias here, and a lot more photos are recent to when I made this in Mid-August, 2024.

		<img src="res/top 7/p7.jpg" alt="High School Graduation", class="picture"> </img>
		<p class="blogParagraph">
			Me and my best friends from elementary school at graduation. We've been friends for more than a decade, and the four of us have enjoyed the highs and supported each other through the lows, and this moment really captured the feeling of hitting a milestone together.

		<br>
		<img src="res/top 7/p6.jpg" alt="Goodbye", class="picture"> </img>
		<p class="blogParagraph">
			Me and one of my best friends at college hugging goodbye during Track Senior Night. Going into college, my biggest fear was not making good friends, since I don't consider myself the most extroverted person. For me, this photo really meant: Yes, I was able to make amazing friends. Paraphrasing Winnie the Pooh, "How lucky are we to have people who make saying goodbye so hard".

		<img src="res/top 7/p5.jpg" alt="Fake Mugshot", class="picture"> </img>
		<p class="blogParagraph">
			LOL I love this one. This is me laughing while posing like a mugshot after getting a parking ticket. As I was driving on an average Saturday, smoke started billowing out of my engine and my car stopped driving on the side of a parking lot. I ultimately got a parking ticket for being outside of the lines. I was initially upset at getting a ticket, but I just laughed it off. I'm generally proud of my ability to deal with these kind of setbacks with humor.

		<img src="res/top 7/p4.jpg" alt="Golf Prowess", class="picture"> </img>
		<p class="blogParagraph">
			These are the two balls I used to hit my first par and birdies in golf. I picked up golf in Summer 2024 to get the chance to spend more time with my dad. I'm very proud of this, because I was able to put my mind towards improving at something I sucked at, and it happened.

		<img src="res/top 7/p3.jpg" alt="STEAK", class="picture"> </img>
		<p class="blogParagraph">
			I love cooking; I've been cooking since I was 10. This was my first steak I cooked for my family (along with the side dishes) It was VERY good.

		<br>
		<br>
		<br>
		<img src="res/top 7/p2.jpg" alt="Martin Garrix", class="picture"> </img>
		<p class="blogParagraph">
			I was lucky enough that my #1 Artist for the past 3 years, Martin Garrix, hosted a couple shows in San Francisco. A lot of his music is connected to a lot of fond memories in my life, and his euphoric style of music never fails to energize me in the morning.

		<img src="res/top 7/p1.jpg" alt="Sunset", class="picture"> </img>
		<p class="blogParagraph">
			An absolute beautiful east coast sunset in Baltimore. East coast sunsets are different than those from home in the west coast. This moment made me realize I made the right decision to choose a school all the way across the country, because it was simply a different environment than what was usual and comfortable to me.
